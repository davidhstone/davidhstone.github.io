description: This app is one of the projects I worked on while in the midst of General Assembly's Android Development Immersive course. The app was given to us somewhat functional, but it lacked the functinality that allowed tablet users to see the zodiac sign list screen, and the horoscope of whatever sign is clicked, on the same screen. The added functionality results not only in increased ease of navigation by making it unneccesary to click the back button to get back to the list of zodiac signs, it also looks a lot better in a split screen than otherwise! This was the result of adding a couple fragments and an intent, and setting the layout_weight attribute to 0.5 for both the frame layout and fragment in the activity_main.xml file for large screens. Pretty cool...
